## This project is not yet complete, nor is it ready to be used. If you fancy helping making it complete, be my guest!

Simple library for producing Force directed graphs!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add fdg to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:fdg, "~> 0.0.2"}]
        end

  2. Ensure fdg is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:fdg]]
        end
